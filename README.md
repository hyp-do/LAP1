# LAP1
Third C# Project for WGU. This was a very interesting project that focused on developing an Android OS application using Xamarin.Forms and SQLite. This course and project built on top of the other two previous courses and then threw in a little bit of a curveball with developing for another platform. It was very fun.  The key take away from this course was research, research, research. Xamarin.Forms is still relatively new and evolving, there was not a ton of relevant help in the course resources.

## Introduction
As a competent mobile application developer, your understanding of mobile application structure and design will help you to develop applications to meet customer requirements.
For this task, you will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their academic terms, courses associated with each term, and assessments associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term, provide notifications for upcoming performance and objective assessments, and notify students of deadlines and tracking milestones even after the application is closed. You will create a wireframe as a visual guide, representing the skeletal framework of the application. Your application will use an SQLite database. 
This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills learned in the course and help you to apply these skills in a familiar, real-world scenario. 
## Requirements
A.	Draw a low-fidelity wireframe for your mobile application that includes all of the following requirements.

1.	As many academic terms as needed; each term should include the addition, deletion, and storage of all of the following:
-	The term title
-	Start and anticipated end dates (Use a DatePicker)
2.	Add six courses for each term. For each course, include the addition, editing, deletion, and storage of all of the following course information:
-	Course name
-	Start and anticipated end dates (Use a DatePicker)
-	Course status (Use a Picker)
-	Course instructor’s information: name, phone, email
-	Add share, and display optional notes
-	Set notifications for the start and end dates of each course
-	Display of a detailed view of each course, including the due date
-	Editing of the detailed course view screen
3.	Add two assessments for each course; each assessment should include the addition, editing, deletion, and storage of all of the following assessment information:
-	One objective assessment
-	One performance assessment
-	Name of both assessments
-	Set notifications for the start and end dates of each assessment

B.	Create within the Xamarin.Forms framework, a mobile application aligned to the wireframe drawn in part A, include all of these features:
1.	Provide an interface for all of the following information for as many academic terms as needed:
-	Academic term title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2, Spring term)
-	Start and end dates (Use a DatePicker)
2.	Provide an interface that allows the user to access all the following features for each academic term:
-	Add and display a list of six courses for each term
-	Display a detailed of each term, including all the information from part B1
3.	Provide the interface that allows the user to access and edit all the following details for each course:
-	Course title
-	Start and anticipated end dates (Use a DatePicker)
-	Course status (e.g., in progress, completed, dropped, plan to take) (Use a Picker)
-	The course instructor’s name, phone number, and email address
4.	Create features that allow the user to do all the following for each course:
-	Add two assessments; one performance assessment and one objective assessment
-	Add and display optional notes
-	Enter, edit, and delete course information
-	Display an editable detailed view of the course, including the due date
-	Set alerts (e.g., notifications) for the start and end date of the course
-	Share notes via a sharing feature (e.g., email, SMS)
5.	Provide an interface for the user to do all of the following for each assessment:
-	Include the names and due dates
-	Enter, edit, and delete assessment information
-	Set notifications for anticipated due dates
6.	Write code to create a set of data for evaluation purposes including one term and one course from part B3 and include the two assessments from part B4 for that course. Include your own name, phone number, and email address as the course instructor for the course. 

C.	Examine the wireframe from part A, to determine any changes that you made during the development of the mobile application.

1.	Explain the reasons for any changes made during the development of the mobile application, by adding comments within the wireframe. If no changes were made, include that comment.
2.	Confirm that, after the inclusion of the changes made during development, the wireframe aligns with the mobile application

D.	Provide a complete and operation source file for your mobile application

E.	Acknowledge sources, using APA-formatted in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.


F.	Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission
